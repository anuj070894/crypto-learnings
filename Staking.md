Proof Of Stake
- Blockchain verification mechanism
- solves some of the problems of PoW
- one miner is chosen and some of the crypto assets are locked and released when it is guessed correctly, otherwise penalised
- PoW - many people run towards the end of the race and only one wins. Others also run and it eventually leads to waste of energy
- PoS - one miner is chosen and he only run. Others validate the miner and things
- there are some companies that act as miners. If they join hands, they can be 51% in majority and you are done.
- PoS tends to solve this
- one miner is seleceted and it's verey important that he/she solves it correctly. If not, they would have to select someone else, and so on and so forth. It would be very time consuming. That's why it's important theey lock up some stake and other validators validate it and peenalize it
- locking up their coins as collateral
- you get staking reward
- selection criteria

risks
- locking period. coin gets in locked state from a month to a year
- technical knowledge
- validator commission
- rewards duration
- bad behaviour - if the validation behaviour is bad, you might get penalized
