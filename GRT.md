GRT(The Graph)
Decentralised and open-source indexing protocol for blockchain data
Publish apis called subgraphs
Used to search for ethereum data through simple queries conveniently
Blockchain applications struggle to adhere to properties such as finality, chain reorganisation, and query fulfilment security
Fully decentralised - more nodes will be involved and made responsible for maintaining the index
1 billion queries last June 2020
Yaniv Tal - CEO of GRT - indexing protocol to make blockchain data easier to access
- Create applications that don’t require servers and make web3 accessible to everyone

How does The Graph work?
- To index ethereum data, GRT uses the “subgraph manifesto”(description of a subgraph that contains data about smart contracts, blockchain events, and the process of mapping event data together before it is all stored in the platform’s database (Smart contract - simply programs on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met)
- The flow of data from transactions, subgraph manifests, and the database follows a certain structure. It all starts with decentralised applications that add data to the ethereum blockchain using smart contracts
- All this data contains a record of all events and transactions up to the point where they reach finality. Then comes the graph node, which scans the entire blockchain database, collects new data, and filters out those relevant to users’ queries. To facilitate indexing, it identifies each piece of information that answers the queries from subgraphs.
- GraphQL is the link between the blockchain data and the application a user wants to feed it to. Finally, after the whole process, users can view their query results from within their application.
- 2300 subgraphs, indexing of data from ethereum, IPFS(InterPlanetary File System) and PoA networks
IPFS - A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer and more open
PoA - Proof Of Assignment is a cryptographic consensus algorithm used to confirm agreement on a distributed and decentralised network
Applications that uses GRT - AAVE, Aragon, Balancer, DAOstack, Uniswap, Synthetix

Key roles of the platform 
- Consumer - users who pay indexer for their searches
- Indexer - nodes that maintain that indexing function of the platform
- Curator - using GRT’s, curators identify for subgraphs the valuable information to the platform’s index
- Delegator - these are other takers who delegate their GRT to exist indexers and earn a portion of the rewards
- Fishermen - they verify that network’s response to queries is correct
- Arbitrator - they decide whether an indexer is malicious or not

The Graph Council
Decentralize its management in the future. 
Similar to MakereDAO and Compound
Plans to create a DAO(Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) to allow core stakeholders to participate in key protocol decisions
Will also be responsible for how The Graph foundation allocates its native utility tokens GRT
Its basic functions include grant and ecosystem funding allocation decisions, protocol upgrades, protocol parameters, and other emergency decisions

The Graph Token(GRT) - or $GRT is its native ERC-20 based token that can serve as a medium of exchange and a reward for community participants who act as indexers, curators and delegators 

GRT staking(process of locking up crypto holdings in order to obtain rewards or earn interest)
